From [Ali Ikhsanul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDECc1yaRYI&list=PLSgiCo_OhhpNeJ9luyZEBflLpRm_IFW79) Salome & OpenFOAM tutorial

Mesh is generated with salome.

Base: compressible/sonicFoam/RAS/prism

Solver: sonicFoam

Turbulence model: RAS

## Flute simulation (case 1)
(OpenFOAM 6)

1. Geometry constructed with Rhino 6

2. Meshing tool snappyHexMesh

3. pimpleFoam solver (openfoam6)
#### Assumptions
1. Embouchure hole half inlet and half outlet.

2. Blow angle 45 degree to embouchure hole perpendicular.
